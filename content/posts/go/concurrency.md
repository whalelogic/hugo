# Concurrency in Go {#concurrency-in-go .title}

Go provides built-in support for concurrent programming, making it easy
to write programs that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
Concurrency in Go is based on two main concepts: **goroutines** and
**channels**.

## Goroutines {#goroutines .subtitle}

A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution. You can start a new
goroutine by using the `go` keyword before a function call. The function
will then run concurrently with the calling function.

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func say(s string) {
        for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
            time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
            fmt.Println(s)
        }
    }

    func main() {
        go say("world")
        say("hello")
    }

In this example, `go say("world")` starts a new goroutine. The `main`
function continues to execute, and both functions run concurrently.

## Channels {#channels .subtitle}

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive
values with the `<-` operator. Channels can be used to communicate
between goroutines.

    package main

    import "fmt"

    func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
        sum := 0
        for _, v := range s {
            sum += v
        }
        c <- sum // send sum to c
    }

    func main() {
        s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

        c := make(chan int)
        go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
        go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
        x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c

        fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
    }

This example creates two goroutines to calculate the sum of two halves
of a slice. The results are sent back to the `main` function through a
channel.

## Select {#select .subtitle}

The `select` statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication
operations. A `select` blocks until one of its cases can run, then it
executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func main() {
        c1 := make(chan string)
        c2 := make(chan string)

        go func() {
            time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
            c1 <- "one"
        }()
        go func() {
            time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
            c2 <- "two"
        }()

        for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
            select {
            case msg1 := <-c1:
                fmt.Println("received", msg1)
            case msg2 := <-c2:
                fmt.Println("received", msg2)
            }
        }
    }

## Sync Package {#sync-package .subtitle}

The `sync` package provides basic synchronization primitives such as
mutual exclusion locks. These are useful for protecting shared data from
being accessed by multiple goroutines at the same time.

- `sync.Mutex`: A mutual exclusion lock.
- `sync.RWMutex`: A reader/writer mutual exclusion lock.
- `sync.WaitGroup`: Waits for a collection of goroutines to finish.
- `sync.Once`: An object that will perform exactly one action.
- `sync.Cond`: A condition variable, a rendezvous point for goroutines
  waiting for or announcing the occurrence of an event.
